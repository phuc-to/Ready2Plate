###OVERVIEW
Ready2Plate is an app designed to streamline the restaurant business. The app does this by
analyzing every possible data point in the day to day operation. This data is created through
optimization of the ordering process, and starts with the customer. The team chose to design this
app in order to make our favorite restaurants more profitable AND more popular!
##GOALS
1. Reduce latency and increase accuracy per order
2. Help restaurants establish better financial practices and optimize flow and purchases.
3. Make restaurants more profitable and popular!
##SPECIFICATIONS
Ready2Plate contains three parts. The first part is a database that allows the restaurant owner to
track all aspects of daily operation. The second part is an ordering system that allows staff to not
have to take orders, which reduces the number of total staff members needed and reduces
incorrect orders as the order is solely handled by the customer and the app. The third and final
part of the app is allowing all parties involved in preparing the food or drink to check stock,
submit orders to the Kitchen or Bar manager if stock is low, and see what ingredients are
required for what dish the moment the customer submits an order.
Once the customer has entered their information in, they view the menu and place an order. All
aspects of the cooking process are tracked from Supplier to Ingredient, through the kitchen, and
then when the plate is delivered to the customers table. Ready2Plate also does this for the bar,
with both Kitchen and Bar receiving separate inventories so separate orders can be made by
each Manager. This allows the kitchen staff and bar staff in maximum scaled applications to work
independently of each other for optimal efficiency.
In the Kitchen, Ready2Plate allows the kitchen staff to see the order as soon as it is placed as
well as all the ingredients that are required to prepare every dish. After the dish is prepared it
goes to pickup, and is brought directly to the table with no guesswork (as the customers location
is marked when they make their order). This will also cut down incorrect orders and food waste
while increasing turnover rates.
Finally, Ready2Plate will decrease the amount of overhead restaurants need per month. The app
accomplishes this by showing exactly which dishes were ordered, and which ingredients were
used so the restaurant can waste less money on extra ingredients, and can create data models
every week to track which entrees are popular so in turn they can order the appropriate items
from the supplier.
